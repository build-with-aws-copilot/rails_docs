In this ebook, I will show you how to build a Rails stack using Docker and AWS Copilot. By the end of this book, you will have:

1. Webservers and workers (Sidekiq) running on ECS Fargate
2. CI/CD pipeline on Github Actions
3. Production and Staging environments on AWS
4. A SSL/TLS certificate installed on the load balancer
5. The webservers running under your domain
